Hello everyone,

This is my first post and I am going to announce my first Python program, HatilApp.
I explained my motivation on the [about](https://alitalhaatici.com/about "Ali Talha Atici - About Page") page, so I didn't prefer to share a post about why I start the writing blog. In that case, I chose to make my first blog as an application announce.

##HatilApp
Last two months, I am working in Galataport Istanbul Technical Office. I am controlling the reports and drawings. I realize the same mistake from different companies. This mistake is about hatil* calculation. In this circumstance, I decided to prepare the program which designs hatils. 

Preparation of the HatilApp has 3 steps:
1) Code the calculations and interface
2) Write up report
3) Make AutoCAD drawing

For this moment, I have done the first step. When I finish other steps, I will share in new posts.

##What can HatilApp do for now?
In this post, I'm going to explain the first step of preparation briefly.

Now, HatilApp has the interface for using the program. It can solve three types of hatil such as, none, one and two horizontal hatil. You can see every result of hatil calculation and you can control the limits.

I used object oriented programming.

An example of calculations.

The interface of HatilApp. There are the results in the bottom side of the window.


*I couldn't translate the "hatil", hatil is not a member of the frame. Hatil is the reinforced concrete member for supporting the wall(brick or masonry wall) against to horizontal loads such as earthquake and wind.
