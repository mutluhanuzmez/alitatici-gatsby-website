Hello everyone,

This is my first post and I am going to announce my first Python program, HatilApp.
I explained my motivation in the [about](https://alitalhaatici.com/about "Ali Talha Atici - About Page") page, so I didn't prefer to share a post about why I start the writing blog. In that case, I chose to make my first blog as an application announce.

##HatilApp
Last two months, I am working in Galataport Istanbul Technical Office. I am controlling the reports and drawings. I realize the same mistake from different companies. This mistake is about hatil* calculation. In this circumstances, I decided to prepare the program which designs hatils. 

Preparation of the HatilApp has 3 step:
1) Code the calculations and interface
2) Write up report
3) Make AutoCAD drawing

##What can HatilApp do for now?
In this post, I'm going to explain first step of preparation briefly.

As I mentioned, this is my first using Python. For this reason, [Mutluhan Uzmez](https://mutluhanuzmez.com "Mutluhan Uzmez Blog") helped me on program's interface and using Github for working together remotely.

I used object oriented programming.

Interface of HatilApp. There are the results in bottom side of window.


*I couldn't translate the "hatil", hatil is not main frame component. Hatil is the reinforced concrete member for supporting the wall(brick or masonry wall) against to horizontal loads such as earthquake and wind.
