Hello everyone,

After a long time, I'm going to share second blog. Today's topic is that using Microsoft Word automatically through Python. 


##WHY
First of all, one of the main motivations to start coding was easing the works about my profession, civil engineering. For this reason, I have to learn at least these three tasks which I also mentioned in [my first blog](https://alitalhaatici.com/blog/firstblogandhatilapp/ "First Blog & HatilApp"):

1) How to code calculation
2) How to write up report
3) How to make AutoCAD drawing

So, by automatizing Microsoft Word with Python, second task will be completed.


##HOW
You can find out many webpages about the topic, yet I used a few of them since I want to share something fundamental about this for now. Here is the sites:
